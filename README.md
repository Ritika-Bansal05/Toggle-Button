# Toggle-Button
Learning Javascript 

This is a small beginner-level JavaScript feature where I created a Friend/Unfriend toggle button.
When you click the button, it changes from "Add Friend" to "Remove Friend" and back.
It helps in understanding how JavaScript interacts with the DOM and handles events.
A simple way to learn about button states, event listeners, and dynamic UI updates.
